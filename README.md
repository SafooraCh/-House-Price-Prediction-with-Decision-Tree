# House Price Prediction with Decision Tree

A machine learning web application that predicts house prices using Decision Tree Regression.

## 🎯 Features
- Interactive slider inputs for house characteristics
- Real-time price predictions
- Feature importance visualization
- Price breakdown analysis
- Responsive design

## 🏠 Input Features
- **Size**: House area in square feet (800-3500 sq ft)
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms (1-6)
- **Age**: Property age in years (0-50 years)
- **Distance**: Distance from city center in km (1-30 km)
